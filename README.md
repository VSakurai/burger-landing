# Burger Landing

This is my first web development project â€” a one-page landing site for a fast food restaurant, built using HTML5 and CSS3.

This project was an important step in learning the basic principles of web page layout and styling.

# About the project:

The project is a one-page site layout that serves as a starting point for further development and adding new functionality, including responsive design, improved semantics, and interactive elements.

# Technologies used:

- HTML5: For creating the page structure.
- CSS3: For styling and design.
